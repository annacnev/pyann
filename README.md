[![Release Version](https://img.shields.io/github/release/annacnev/pyann.svg)](https://github.com/annacnev/pyann/releases/latest) 

A Python implementation of the [RANN](https://github.com/jefferislab/RANN) package for R.

Finds the k nearest neighbours for every point in a given dataset
in O(N log N) time using Arya and Mount's ANN library (v1.1.3). There is
support for approximate as well as exact searches, fixed radius searches
and bd as well as kd trees.

This package implements nearest neighbors for the Euclidean (L2) metric.

For further details on the underlying ANN library, see http://www.cs.umd.edu/~mount/ANN.
